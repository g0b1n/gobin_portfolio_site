          <p className="text-lg leading-7">
            I have completed a software engineering course with Springboard and spent two years studying Graphic Design at Pennsylvania College of Arts and Design before transferring to PennState World Campus for Multimedia Design. While art and design remain my passion, I am dedicated to building a career as a software engineer.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-7 mt-4">
            I bring a unique blend of artistic creativity and technical expertise, aiming to contribute innovative, user-centric solutions as a front-end developer. I am seeking opportunities in small to medium-sized companies where I can engage in hands-on projects, enhance my skills, and help drive the companyâ€™s growth by making its products more engaging and accessible to a global audience.
